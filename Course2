Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Name: Irshad AHamed
Module: Dynamic Programming
Learning: Learnt about how dynamic programming works.Dynamic programming breaks down problems into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively. Dynamic programming stores the answers to subproblems in a table or matrix so they don't need to be recomputed. This saves time and helps find the optimal solution
